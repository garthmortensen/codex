# pytest monkeypatching

## using pytest, how do i add a monkeypatch for this script? i dont understand what monkeypatching is. give me a simple applied example and explanation

Monkeypatching in the context of testing with `pytest` is a way to dynamically change or replace code at runtime. It's particularly useful for altering or replacing functions, methods, or attributes in your code while testing, to ensure your tests don't rely on external dependencies like databases, file systems, or network resources.

Let's say you want to test `increment_group_id` but without actually connecting to a database. You can use `pytest`'s monkeypatch feature to replace the `sqlite3.connect` function with a mock function that doesn't open a real database connection.

Here's an example of how you could write a test using monkeypatching:

```python
import pytest
from your_script import increment_group_id

def mock_connect(database_name):
    class MockCursor:
        def execute(self, query):
            pass
        def fetchone(self):
            return [42]
        def close(self):
            pass

    class MockConnection:
        def cursor(self):
            return MockCursor()
        def close(self):
            pass

    return MockConnection()

def test_increment_group_id(monkeypatch):
    # Replace sqlite3.connect with our mock_connect function
    monkeypatch.setattr('sqlite3', 'connect', mock_connect)

    # Call the function under test
    result = increment_group_id("dummy_database.db", "dummy_table")

    # Assert the expected outcome
    assert result == 43
```

In this test:
1. We define a `mock_connect` function that returns a mock connection object. This object has a mock cursor that returns predefined results.
2. The `monkeypatch.setattr` method is used to replace `sqlite3.connect` with our `mock_connect` function.
3. We then call `increment_group_id` and assert that it behaves as expected, given the mocked database responses.

With monkeypatching, you're temporarily altering the behavior of a part of your code during the test. After the test, the changes are reverted, so the original behavior is restored. This is incredibly useful for isolating tests from external factors.

## example 2

Certainly! Let's create a monkeypatch for the `get_user_specified_models` function in your script. This function reads a JSON file to determine which models to include in a group run. In a test environment, you might want to avoid actual file I/O operations. Here, monkeypatching can be used to replace the `open` function so that it returns a mock file object instead of reading a real file.

Here's an example of how you might set up a test using `pytest`'s monkeypatching:

```python
import pytest
from your_script import get_user_specified_models
from io import StringIO

def test_get_user_specified_models(monkeypatch):
    # Sample JSON data to be returned by our mock open
    mock_file_data = '{"group_run": {"include": {"r_energy.R": true, "r_concrete.R": false, "r_lumber.R": true}}}'

    # A mock function to replace open
    def mock_open(file_path, mode):
        if file_path == "dummy_path.json" and mode == 'r':
            return StringIO(mock_file_data)
        else:
            raise FileNotFoundError

    # Use monkeypatch to replace the built-in open function with our mock function
    monkeypatch.setattr("builtins.open", mock_open)

    # Call the function under test
    models = get_user_specified_models("dummy_path.json")

    # Assert the expected output
    assert models == ["r_energy.R", "r_lumber.R"]

# Run the test
test_get_user_specified_models()
```

In this test:
1. We create a `mock_open` function that simulates opening a file. It returns a `StringIO` object initialized with our mock file data, mimicking a file with JSON content.
2. We use the `monkeypatch.setattr` method to replace the built-in `open` function with `mock_open`.
3. We then call `get_user_specified_models` and assert that it correctly interprets the mock data.

This approach lets you test the functionality of `get_user_specified_models` without relying on actual file reads, making the test faster and more reliable.
