# reverse proxy

## reverse proxy is unclear to me. is it hardware or software? 

A reverse proxy can be either a hardware appliance or, more commonly, a software service. It serves as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from servers.

In simple terms, a reverse proxy sits in front of one or more web servers and forwards client (e.g., browser) requests to those web servers. The reverse proxy then returns the responses from the servers back to the clients. Hereâ€™s what makes it distinct:

**Software Reverse Proxy:**
- Most often, when someone refers to a reverse proxy, they are talking about a software service.
- This software runs on a physical server or a virtual machine and listens for incoming client requests on the network.
- Examples of software that can act as a reverse proxy include Nginx, Apache with mod_proxy, HAProxy, and many others.

**Hardware Reverse Proxy:**
- In some enterprise setups, a dedicated hardware device might be used as a reverse proxy.
- These are specialized devices that are optimized to handle network traffic and load balancing.
- Hardware reverse proxies are less common and tend to be used in high-volume environments where performance is critical.

**Functionality:**
- Whether hardware or software, a reverse proxy provides various functionalities like load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and more.
- It can distribute traffic across several servers, cache content for quicker access, handle SSL encryption and decryption, and provide an additional layer of security.

**Why Use a Reverse Proxy?**
- It can offload work from web servers, improve performance, manage SSL/TLS, provide additional security, and more.
- It simplifies network infrastructure by providing a single point of contact/control for all incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- For the client, it is completely transparent. The client sends a request to a single IP address, and the reverse proxy takes care of making sure it reaches the right server on the backend.

In conclusion, a reverse proxy is not a specific piece of hardware or software but rather a function that can be performed by various networking components, depending on the needs of the system.

## why is it called a reverse proxy? Explain it in simple terms

A reverse proxy is called "reverse" because it functions oppositely to a regular, or forward, proxy. To understand this, let's look at what each type of proxy does:

**Forward Proxy:**

- Think of a forward proxy as a middleman that sits between your computer and the internet.
- When you request a webpage, the forward proxy receives the request, makes the request on your behalf, and then sends the webpage back to you.
- This is used to provide internet access to internal network clients that are otherwise restricted, to cache content for faster access, and to anonymize web requests for privacy.

**Reverse Proxy:**

- A reverse proxy also acts as a middleman, but it sits between the internet and a server that hosts websites or web applications.
- When the internet sends a request to your website, the reverse proxy intercepts this request. It can then perform various tasks such as load balancing, caching, SSL encryption, and then passes the request to the web server. When the web server responds, the reverse proxy sends that response back to the internet user.
- The term "reverse" comes into play because, unlike a forward proxy that serves the client (user), the reverse proxy serves the server (the website or web application). It takes requests from the internet and sends them to the appropriate server.

In simple terms, if a forward proxy is like a personal assistant who goes out to get things on your behalf, a reverse proxy is like a receptionist or bouncer at a club, deciding which visitors to let in, managing the crowd, and providing security.
