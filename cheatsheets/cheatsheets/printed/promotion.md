# promotion

## i spent several months prototyping a fullstack flask app off the clock. it's a top priority item for our department to complete this year, and i did it on my own, after hours. it required fullstack skills in relational database schema and seed, python, html, css, and restful api. how can i self promote my work without coming off boastful? i am a humble person and uncomfortable with self promotion, but i recognize that doing this is good for your career. 

Self-promotion, especially when it's about showcasing genuine achievements, can be done tastefully and effectively while maintaining humility. Here are some strategies:

1. **Use Facts Over Opinions**: Talk about your project in terms of what you achieved using factual information. For instance, you could say, “I developed a full-stack application that fulfills our department’s need for XYZ, which we targeted to complete this year.”

   > We developed a full-stack application that fulfills our department’s need, which we targeted to complete this year.

2. **Problem-Solution Results Framework**: Describe the problem that existed, the solution you created, and the benefits it brings. This approach keeps the focus on the value of the work rather than on yourself.

   > The old tracker approach introduced human error and frustration. Users would often overwrite or typo ids, and dealing with multiple trackers was frustrating.

3. **Seek Feedback**: Approach it from a learning perspective. Ask for feedback from your peers or superiors, saying something like, "I've been working on this project to improve our processes. I'd love your input on how it can be integrated with our current systems."

   > We think this is nearly at a steady state. Before locking in on this though, we're interested in your feedback. At least 2 forms of feedback.
   >
   > 1. Intrinsic flaws that will prevent this from working. Please kill it now, before we sink additional time.
   > 2. Ways to improve it before we're locked-in. 

4. **Share Your Learning Experience**: Talk about the challenges you faced and how you overcame them. This not only showcases your problem-solving skills but also emphasizes your dedication to professional growth.

   > Challenge: How to provide quality display?
   >
   > Solution: Bootstrap
   >
   > Challenge: Evolve from simple view display to entry.
   >
   > Solution: Required carving data up into tables for entity-specific inserts.
   >
   > Challenge: Synthetic data was insufficient.
   >
   > Solution: Select from database tables to assemble semi-real data.

5. **Give Credit to Collaboration**: If others helped you in any way, acknowledge their contribution. This shows that while you led the initiative, you value teamwork.

   > We needed leadership to identify it and prioritize it as a problem. 
   >
   > We started developing this in isolation, but it greatly improved given your feedback. The first people to give advice gave us the most to rework, while subsequent reviewers gave us some repeat advise. While we were implement most suggestions, certain ones (Angular UI/UX) would have been difficult.

6. **Document the Process**: Create a case study or a detailed report of your project. This serves as an objective record of your work that others can reference.

7. **Utilize Performance Reviews**: Use scheduled performance reviews to discuss your project's impact. This is a formal setting where it’s expected to discuss your contributions.

8. **Teach Others**: Offer to give a presentation or a workshop on what you learned during the project. This positions you as a helpful resource rather than someone just looking to get ahead.

   > we can do a workshop if interest.

9. **Casual Conversations**: In informal settings, mention the project as something you are passionate about, focusing on how much you enjoyed the work.

   > we had a good time

10. **Leverage LinkedIn**: Update your LinkedIn profile with the project details in your portfolio section. This is a professional and subtle way to showcase your work.

> Had a great time collaborating with Victor prototyping a fullstack solution. 

Remember, self-promotion doesn't have to be about singing your own praises; it can be about sharing your passion, the challenges you've tackled, and the knowledge you’ve gained. This way, you're providing value through your experiences, which naturally shines a positive light on your efforts and skills.
