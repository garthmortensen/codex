# microservices

## Explain micro services in simple terms. Show me Python code that uses it

Microservices are a way of designing and building software applications by breaking them into small, independent, and loosely-coupled components that perform specific functions. Each microservice can run independently and communicate with other microservices to create a larger application.

Here's a simple Python example that demonstrates a basic microservices architecture using the Flask framework for building web services. This example includes two microservices, one for user management and another for product management.

1. User Microservice (user_service.py):
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

users = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"},
]

@app.route('/users')
def get_users():
    return jsonify(users)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

2. Product Microservice (product_service.py):
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

products = [
    {"id": 101, "name": "Product A"},
    {"id": 102, "name": "Product B"},
]

@app.route('/products')
def get_products():
    return jsonify(products)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we have two separate microservices, each responsible for a specific part of the application. They expose REST APIs to interact with user and product data.

To use these microservices, you can make HTTP requests to their respective endpoints. For instance, you can use Python's `requests` library to access the data:

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request to the User Microservice
user_response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/users')
user_data = user_response.json()
print(user_data)

# Make a GET request to the Product Microservice
product_response = requests.get('http://localhost:5001/products')
product_data = product_response.json()
print(product_data)
```

This is a simplified example to illustrate the concept of microservices. In real-world scenarios, microservices can be more complex, and you would typically use tools like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for managing them in a production environment.

## is it a microservice because there are 2 scripts running? do they need to run on different servers? what makes this different from simple api calls?

Microservices are not defined by the number of scripts or services running, but by their architectural approach and design principles. In the example I provided, we have two separate Python scripts, each running a service, but it doesn't necessarily make them microservices by default. Microservices are characterized by the following key principles:

1. **Independence:** Each microservice should be a self-contained and independent component responsible for a specific business capability. They can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

2. **Loose Coupling:** Microservices should communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, often over HTTP or other communication protocols. They should not be tightly coupled, meaning changes in one microservice should not impact others.

3. **Scalability:** Microservices can be individually scaled to handle the load specific to their functionality. For example, if the product service is experiencing high traffic, you can scale it independently from the user service.

4. **Separate Deployment:** Microservices can be deployed on different servers, containers, or even cloud instances, but it's not a strict requirement. They can run on the same server or container if it makes sense for your use case.

In the example I provided, the two services run as separate Python scripts, but they are not truly independent microservices because they share the same server (using different ports). They also do not communicate with each other in the example.

The key difference between microservices and simple API calls is the architectural approach and the level of decoupling. In the example, you could consider them as separate APIs, but they lack the true independence and scalability features that are typical of microservices. In a real microservices architecture, you might have many microservices running on different servers or containers, working together to form a complete application, and they would interact more extensively with each other and have other features like service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
