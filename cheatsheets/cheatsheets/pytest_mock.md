# pytest mocking

## using pytest, how do i add a mock test for this script? i dont understand what mocking is. give me a simple applied example and explanation

Mocking in testing, especially in the context of Python and `pytest`, is a technique used to replace real objects in your system with controlled replacements. This is particularly useful when dealing with external resources or systems that you don't want to actually call during testing, such as databases, file systems, or external services.

In your script, you interact with a database, read from files, and even execute external scripts. These are perfect candidates for mocking, as you typically don't want your tests to depend on a real database or file system.

Let's focus on a specific part of your script for a mock test. Suppose we want to test the `increment_group_id` function without actually connecting to a real SQLite database. To do this, we can use `unittest.mock` from Python's standard library, which is fully compatible with `pytest`.

Here's a simple example of how you might write a test for the `increment_group_id` function using mocking:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from your_script import increment_group_id

def test_increment_group_id():
    # Mock the sqlite3.connect method to return a MagicMock object
    with patch('sqlite3.connect') as mock_connect:
        mock_conn = MagicMock()
        mock_cursor = MagicMock()
        mock_connect.return_value = mock_conn
        mock_conn.cursor.return_value = mock_cursor

        # Set up the cursor to return a specific value when fetchone is called
        mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = [42]

        # Call the function under test
        result = increment_group_id("dummy_database.db", "dummy_table")

        # Assert that the function returns the correct incremented value
        assert result == 43

        # You can also assert that the cursor executed the expected SQL query
        mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_with('select distinct max(group_id) from dummy_table')
```

In this example:
1. We use `patch` to replace `sqlite3.connect` with a mock object. This means whenever your function tries to connect to a database, it gets a mock object instead of a real connection.
2. We configure the mock object to behave in a certain way (e.g., `mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = [42]`), which lets us control the output of database queries.
3. We then call the `increment_group_id` function and assert that it behaves as expected, given the mocked database responses.

This way, you can test how your function behaves without needing a real database connection. Mocking can be applied similarly to other parts of your script, like file reading/writing or running subprocesses.

## example 2

Let's create a mock test for the `get_user_specified_models` function from your script. This function reads from a JSON file and extracts model information. In a test, you typically don't want to rely on actual file I/O operations. Mocking comes in handy here to simulate reading from a file without having to create or read an actual file.

Here's how you might set up a test using `unittest.mock`:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, mock_open
from your_script import get_user_specified_models

def test_get_user_specified_models():
    # Sample data to be returned by our mock open
    mock_file_data = '{"group_run": {"include": {"r_energy.R": true, "r_concrete.R": false, "r_lumber.R": true}}}'

    # Use patch to mock the open function
    with patch("builtins.open", mock_open(read_data=mock_file_data)) as mock_file:
        # Call the function under test
        models = get_user_specified_models("dummy_path.json")

        # Assert the expected output
        assert models == ["r_energy.R", "r_lumber.R"]

        # Assert that open was called with the correct file path
        mock_file.assert_called_with("dummy_path.json", "r")
```

In this test:
1. We use `mock_open` to simulate the file reading operation. `mock_open` is given a string that represents the contents of the file.
2. We patch the built-in `open` function, so when `get_user_specified_models` tries to open a file, it uses our mock instead of the real file system.
3. We then call `get_user_specified_models` and check if it returns the correct list of models, based on our mock file data.
4. Finally, we assert that our mock file was opened with the correct arguments (file path and mode).

This test ensures that `get_user_specified_models` correctly processes the input from a file and extracts the needed information without relying on actual file system operations.
